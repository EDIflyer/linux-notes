title: "4 - Material for MkDocs setup"
---
See [`triggerscript.sh`](../triggerscript.sh) for the build command for the deployed setup, however for testing changes live a persistent container serving mkdocs-material is much quicker and easier to use.

We want to use the [mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin) and the [MkDocs GLightbox plugin](https://github.com/blueswen/mkdocs-glightbox) - these need to be installed by `pip` on top of the main `mkdocs-material` image, therefore we need to create a custom Dockerfile to add the revelant commands and create a custom image before we can activate them in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file:
??? example "mkdocs.dockerfile - use in Portainer as Images > Build image"
    ``` docker linenums="1"
    FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    RUN pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
    RUN pip install mkdocs-glightbox
    RUN git config --global --add safe.directory /docs
    ```
    Once we have created that file we can then either build the custom image using the following command:  
    ``` bash
    docker build --tag="custom/mkdocs-material" --file="mkdocs.dockerfile" .
    ```
    (the `.` at the end is important as it sets the build context and the command won't work without it!)  
    
    Or using Portainer we can just paste directly in as a custom image:  
    Name: `custom/mkdocs-material`
    ![](../images/2022-07-10-12-16-58.png)

Now that the custom image has been created we can use a docker-compose file to create a stack in Portainer.  The benefit of having this as a stack as is that we can easily re-deploy it.

??? example "docker-compose/mkdocs-live.yml"
    ``` yaml linenums="1"
    --8<-- "docs/server-setup/docker-compose/mkdocs-live.yml"
    ```

## Docker compose file for mkdocs-material with date plugin
FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material
RUN pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
RUN git config --global --add safe.directory /docs

<!-- ## Hugo installation
Download latest Hugo version from `https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases` and copy to `/usr/local/bin`

Create new Hugo site in the repository
```
cd repositories
hugo new site --force <repo name>/
```

Add the following to .gitignore
```
nano <repo name>/.gitignore

public/
```

Add theme
```
cd <reponame>
git submodule add https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git themes/hugo-theme-relearn
```

Edit `config.toml`
# Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo
theme = "hugo-theme-relearn" -->

### NGINX install
When deploying container, **be sure to set network to nginx-proxy-manager_default**. Also bind /usr/share/nginx/html on the container to /var/www/<sitename>/html on the host

In NPM add proxy host - enter subdomain.domain.tld then redirect to docker container name on relevant port

<!-- ### Setup site on NGINX
Add the following line to the http block of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf to disable version info
server_tokens off;

Create /var/www/<sitename.domain.tld>/html
`cd /etc/nginx/conf.d`
`sudo mv default.conf default.conf.disabled`
`sudo cp default.conf <sitename.domain.tld>.conf`
edit server_name and change to FQDN
change locations to /var/www/<sitename.domain.tld>/html
different locations (e.g. /blog/) can redirect to different servers on the folder.

Check config and reload
`sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload`

## SSL/TLS setup
```
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --nginx
```

to test cert renewal
`sudo certbot renew --dry-run`
(see https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=debianbuster for explanation of terminology) -->

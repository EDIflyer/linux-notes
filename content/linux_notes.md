`env` to print environment variables 
to find recursively in folders...
find . -name '*.xml'
`ip a` (list ip addresses)

## iperf

Connect client:
`iperf -c <ip_of_server>`

## BASH tips
Ctrl-U clear line
Ctrl-L clear screen
Ctrl-R search command history
cd - to switch between directories

# command line startup - either pfetch (v compact) or neofetch (bigger but prettier)
wget https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch/raw/master/pfetch
chmod +x pfetch
sudo cp pfetch /usr/bin/local
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
pfetch
sudo nano ~/.config/neofetch/config.conf [to uncomment IP addresses]

# btop (formerly bpytop)
pre-requisite: sudo apt install bzip2 make
go to https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest
wget [latest x64 version for Linode, armv7l for Pi]
tar -xjf [filename].tgz
./install.sh

# nano
[Ctrl]-[z] to background
`fg` on terminal to then run again
`jobs` to list currently running background processes

# ncdu
shows usage by directory
`sudo apt instal ncdu`
`sudo ncdu -x /` (to only show files from root but on local filesystem)

# glances
pip3 install glances
pip3 install bottle
glances -w

# Bash history

space before command to stop it going into history

# export PuTtY settings & sessions
regedit /e "%userprofile%\desktop\putty-registry.reg" HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Simontatham

# setup SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

This creates:
id_rsa [private key - to use as identifier on the client when trying to access the host, is in OpenSSH format]
id_rsa.pub [public key - to go into .ssh/authorized_keys file on the host]

cd ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
then move id_rsa to PC

For PuTTY use:
use puttygen (Conversions > Import key > Save private key) to convert this non-.pub file to PuTTY private key format and point to this in Connection > SSH > Auth. Also add username to Connection > Data

SSHFS
install sshfs and it allows remote directories to be mounted as local directories

UPGRADING
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md
sudo apt dist-upgrade {upgrade to latest version of Raspbian - beware kills wifi}
sudo apt install rpi-update
sudo rpi-update {updates bleeding edge kernel}
uname -r {check kernel version}

# secure SSH access
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart sshd

Changing desktop
https://raspberrypiuser.co.uk/how-to-install-a-new-desktop-environment-using-raspberry-pi-os

Check current path list
